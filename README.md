# MAW
Machine A Woosh - Simple graphical noise shaping tool 

/!\ CARE FOR YOUR EARS !! Audio is nice and all, but hearing damage is real, so always have a way to kill the process or mute the sound very fast in case things get messy. I put as many guard rails as I could, but MAW is STILL an experimental student project, so don't trust anything and don't blow up your ears please. I won't be responsible if you get hurt using my Pure Data patch.


This is a student project for a Pure Data intro class, so I might or might now continue developing on the side. It's a free project, so you can use it however you want.

I'm not a software developer and the code is messy, unorganized, unoptimized and might break in your hands because I've learnt a lot of things between the start and the end of the dev time.
